# Adding Your Resume PDF

To enable the "Download Resume" button:

1. Place your resume PDF file in the `app/public/` directory
2. Name it `resume.pdf` (or update the filename in `app/src/pages/Home.jsx` line 10)
3. The button will automatically download the file when clicked

**Note:** Make sure your PDF file is optimized and not too large (recommended: under 2MB) for better user experience.
