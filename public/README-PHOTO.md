# Adding Your Photo

To add your profile photo:

1. Place your photo file in the `app/public/` directory
2. Name it `profile-photo.jpg` (or update the path in `app/src/pages/Home.jsx`)
3. Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`
4. Recommended size: 400x400px or larger (square aspect ratio works best)
5. The photo will automatically display in a circular frame on the Home page

If the photo is not found, a placeholder with your initials "SL" will be displayed instead.
